# IniLib
This is a personal project - a simple parser &amp; writer for the .ini format, written in c++.
Currently in its most basic and core form it is able to parse basic .ini syntax into a simple object, although not yet tested extensively.
It is to be changed and expanded upon later.

In the future it will contain such features as:
• Extensive sub-secttion trees parsing
• Default-type deduced fields, able to parse ints, doubles, booleans and chars and freely convert between them at the user's command
• Parser config to determine the default behavior of the parser, also recognizable from within the parsed file
• An object factory to create and write data into an .ini file.
